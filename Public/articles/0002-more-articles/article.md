# A little bit more about this project/page thing

So this is all home brew stuff. Just lots of reading and research into how the main tech of this
stack works. Primarily, I wanted to do something "barebones". Write up another "server" that I
could actually connect to the innermanetz and show off to folks.

One of the things that I've never had and kinda always wanted was one of these fancy CV pages. It's
a chance for someone to click around on the things you've built and work on, and see what you come
up with. I am *not* a designer. I don't have very strong "user experience" skills when it comes
to defining my own components. I can come up with highly functional things, sure, but don't expect
something clean, streamlined, "ooh la la' out of me just yet. I follow trendy looking boxes and radii
and stick them in place and see what works.

That last part stinks. I'm hyper specialized in mobile development for Android and iOS and can code
myself into and out of any number of paper bags one could think of. However, I haven't spent a lot of
time *designing* those apps; consuming and iterating on existing designs was my highest priority.

This page is an attempt to get better at that. Make a web page that looks decent on phones and laptops.
Avoiding the common thing of picking a bunch of tech that says it works together, and figuring out
how to build up from there. I'd much rather make a ton of mistakes at this level - what the _hell_ it
is that I'm actually sending over the wire and how does it end up rendered - than working down from
however many abstractions are between me and my responses.

Some of that may sound ludditic, but it really is just a goal to get away from BigTech. Learn something
useful. Play with my own code and language skills. Go on tangents.

It's a pleasure to have had you read my nonsense. Thank you for sharing your human time with me, digitally.
