# So here's what I know

* The Raspberry Pi should be the thing I host these articles on for a while.
* The Pi will directly wired in to the local network, and be forwarded through a router (or two).
* The Pi should supports HTTPS insofar as it is possible to implement to reasonable standards.
* I am winging absolutely everything.
* I should document everything I do that does something.
* Or doesn't.

```shell script
# I used these to do the stuff on this page

# Find local network ip. Experiment with it.
$ sudo lshw -class network | grep -i "ip="
$ ip a
```

So first off, here's I am now. I know I want to support a secure connection to these pages. I'm not
collecting any kind of information, but it seems to be a good practice. To that end, I've gotten
as far as acquiring a legitimate certificate from (LetsEncrypt)[https://letsencrypt.org/]. I did
this on *not* the Pi because the Pi was experiencing a major existential crisis in terms of not
being logged in to a user session, ergo not connected to the network. Probably.

Anyway.

I know about this thing called [CertBot](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/intro.html). It's an automated 
tool that... well, this is what is does:

>
> Certbot is an easy-to-use client that fetches a certificate from Let’s Encrypt—an open certificate
> authority launched by the EFF, Mozilla, and others—and deploys it to a web server.  
>> Very noble
>
> Anyone who has gone through the trouble of setting up a secure website knows what a hassle getting 
> and maintaining a certificate is. Certbot and Let’s Encrypt can automate away the pain and let you 
> turn on and manage HTTPS with simple commands. Using Certbot and Let’s Encrypt is free, so there’s 
> no need to arrange payment.
>> After you go through some of the steps to get this working, and get a personal look at the output
>> of the scripts, you'll most certainly appreciate the work put in to automation.

At [CertBot's home page](https://certbot.eff.org/), there's a nice little interactive guide that 
lists out fairly reasonably easy-to-follow instructions if you're one to get down and dangerous with
a command shell. It didn't work for me. In my case, I'm using a Java-based server called 
[Javalin](https://javalin.io/). It's a nice little Kotlin layer over [Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/).
There's a lot there to look over, there, but let's just assume we're at the point of serving pages.

So first, let's get CertBot onto the Pi:

```shell script
# Get the package manager so we can get the package.. oof.
$ sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core

# Ok so here's the thing we actually want. 'classic' is suggested in the tutorial.
$ sudo snap install --classic certbot
certbot 1.12.0 from Certbot Project (certbot-eff✓) installed

# Now link(sym).
$ sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot

# Ok, since there's no server running, we can use the standalone version. Let's see.
$ sudo certbot certonly --standalone

# Ok, great, I have a certificate now! _What do I do with it?_

Great question. So it turns out you end up with a few PEM's a the end of the CertBot portion
of this exercise. 

```shell script
$  sudo ls /etc/letsencrypt/live/$YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME_HERE
README	cert.pem  chain.pem  fullchain.pem  privkey.pem
```

So those are files. What's a ~~Paladin~~ PEM?

> There are several commonly used filename extensions for X.509 certificates. Unfortunately, some of these extensions are also used for other data such as private keys.
> 
> * .pem – (Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail) Base64 encoded DER certificate, enclosed between "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and "-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
> * .cer, .crt, .der – usually in binary DER form, but Base64-encoded certificates are common too (see .pem above)
> * .p7b, .p7c – PKCS#7 SignedData structure without data, just certificate(s) or CRL(s)
> * .p12 – PKCS#12, may contain certificate(s) (public) and private keys (password protected)
> * .pfx – PFX, predecessor of PKCS#12 (usually contains data in PKCS#12 format, e.g., with PFX files generated in IIS)
> * PKCS#7 is a standard for signing or encrypting (officially called "enveloping") data. Since the certificate is needed to verify signed data, it is possible to include them in the SignedData structure. A .P7C file is a degenerated SignedData structure, without any data to sign.[citation needed]
> 
> PKCS#12 evolved from the personal information exchange (PFX) standard and is used to exchange public and private objects in a single file.[citation needed]

Ok so.. it's a file type for a.. X.509?

> In cryptography, X.509 is a standard defining the format of public key certificates.[1] 
> X.509 certificates are used in many Internet protocols, including TLS/SSL, which is the basis for 
> HTTPS,[2] the secure protocol for browsing the web. They are also used in offline applications, 
> like electronic signatures. An X.509 certificate contains a public key and an identity (a hostname,
>  or an organization, or an individual), and is either signed by a certificate authority or 
> self-signed. When a certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority, or validated by other 
> means, someone holding that certificate can rely on the public key it contains to establish secure 
> communications with another party, or validate documents digitally signed by the corresponding 
> private key.

Oh. Got it. Particular file format for signatures and keys. Fancy. So I've got one of these, and I 
want to make my Javalin instance all secure and stuff. [The docs](https://javalin.io/documentation#server-setup)
say to [go here and follow the sample](https://github.com/tipsy/javalin-http2-example/).


```kotlin
// blob/master/src/main/kotlin/app/Main.kt

private fun createHttp2Server(): Server {

    val alpn = ALPNServerConnectionFactory().apply {
        defaultProtocol = "h2"
    }

    val sslContextFactory = SslContextFactory().apply {
        keyStorePath = Main::class.java.getResource("/keystore.jks").toExternalForm() // replace with your real keystore
        setKeyStorePassword("password") // replace with your real password
        cipherComparator = HTTP2Cipher.COMPARATOR
        provider = "Conscrypt"
    }

    val ssl = SslConnectionFactory(sslContextFactory, alpn.protocol)

    val httpsConfig = HttpConfiguration().apply {
        sendServerVersion = false
        secureScheme = "https"
        securePort = 8443
        addCustomizer(SecureRequestCustomizer())
    }

    val http2 = HTTP2ServerConnectionFactory(httpsConfig)

    val fallback = HttpConnectionFactory(httpsConfig)

    return Server().apply {
        //HTTP/1.1 Connector
        addConnector(ServerConnector(server).apply {
            port = 8080
        })
        // HTTP/2 Connector
        addConnector(ServerConnector(server, ssl, alpn, http2, fallback).apply {
            port = 8443
        })
    }

}
```

That all seems reasonable except... wait... `.jks`? *_I DON'T HAVE A JKS I HAVE A PEM I HATE COMPUTERS._*.
So you search for that and you might find something like 
[the ancient tomes from the unspoken one](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E35976_01/server.740/es_admin/src/tadm_ssl_convert_pem_to_jks.html).

> This topic describes how to convert PEM-format certificates to the standard Java KeyStore (JKS) format.

Oh we're about to get to _sorceror levels of magical_, aren't we? I hate computers. I copied this page
into a gist because hey it's free to copy these days and 
[why not make more noise on the internet](https://gist.github.com/tikimcfee/01b6a4a0f98d6f657e12ef6a46892482)?
The general idea is this:

* `openssl`; "... run the openssl utility from the directory of your choice."
* `keytool`; "Your path will allow you to use the keytool utility from the directory of your choice."
* All of the input files are located in the local directory.
** This part is a lie. You'll have to navigate around directories yourself a bit. Pay attention
to pathing and domains and such in the sample below.

Let's begin.

```shell script
# Alias to wherever CertBot dropped your keys
$ DOMAIN="etc/letsencrypt/live/$YOUR_DOMAIN"

# I highly recommend trying this to make sure you see something
$ sudo cat $DOMAIN/fullchain.pem

# Here's the magic. You need both the private key and the fullchain certificate to create a
# properly packaged pkcs12. It'll have some  
$ sudo openssl pkcs12 -export -in $DOMAIN/fullchain.pem -inkey $DOMAIN/privkey.pem -out converted.pkcs12

# At the point, the docs say this. If I had any hope before, it is washed away now.
#   Create and then delete an empty truststore using the following commands:
#   keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias endeca -keystore truststore.ks
#   keytool -delete -alias endeca -keystore truststore.ks
# Why do we need to do this? Was something being initialized? WHO KNOWS!? ONLY THE UNSPOKEN ONE!
# Do it and follow all the instructions. Tab through the names and make sure you delete the right alias.
$ keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias letsencrypt-ca -keystore truststore.ks
$ keytool -delete -alias letsencrypt-ca -keystore truststore.ks

# Well here's more magic commands
#   keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -alias endeca-ca -file eneCA.pem -keystore truststore.ks
# Our version looks something like:
$ sudo keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -alias letsencrypt-ca -file $DOMAIN/fullchain.pem -keystore truststore.ks
[...]
Trust this certificate? [no]:  yes
Certificate was added to keystore
[Storing truststore.ks]

# More magic initialization stuff; I suppose it's creating a new record? Magic...
$ keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias letsencrypt-ca -keystore keystore.jks
$ keytool -delete -alias letsencrypt-ca -keystore keystore.jks

# Alright... here we go...
$ keytool -v -importkeystore -srckeystore converted.pkcs12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -destkeystore keystore.jks -deststoretype JKS
Importing keystore converted.pkcs12 to keystore.jks...
Enter destination keystore password:
Enter source keystore password:
Entry for alias 1 successfully imported.
Import command completed:  1 entries successfully imported, 0 entries failed or cancelled
[Storing keystore.jks]

$ ls
converted.pkcs12  keystore.jks  truststore.ks

```

Wow. We have a keystore now. I think a new article would be to automate the above manually. I'm sure
there are tools, but hey, why not just do it yourself eh? So alright. Now we hop back to our code 
sample and start changing things around to work for us. I'm planning on using external files instead
of resources. That's probably a bad idea. Oh well! For now, let's get things fixed from the above 
sample; *Note: IPHelper is just a constants file*:

```kotlin
private val server: Server by lazy {
    Server().apply {
        val httpConfig = HttpConfiguration().apply {
            sendServerVersion = false
            secureScheme = IPHelper.encryptedProtocolHttps
            securePort = IPHelper.preferredEncryptedHttpsPort 
        }
        val httpsConfig = HttpConfiguration(httpConfig).apply {
            addCustomizer(SecureRequestCustomizer())
        }
        val sslContextFactory = SslContextFactory.Server().apply {
            // Find a way to read your password securely. I'm doing it from a file.
            setKeyStorePassword(readKeystorePassword())
            // Get the path to your keystore somehow. Be sure to test running in different contexts.
            keyStorePath = YourFileTools.keystoreFilePath
            provider = "Conscrypt"
            // This comes from jetty, but this may not actually work
            cipherComparator = HTTP2Cipher.COMPARATOR
        }

        // Connection Factories
        val http2ConnectionFactory = HTTP2ServerConnectionFactory(httpsConfig)
        val alpnConnectionFactory = ALPNServerConnectionFactory().apply {
            // More magic constants, love 'em.
            defaultProtocol = "h2"
        }
        val sslConnectionFactory = SslConnectionFactory(
            sslContextFactory,
            alpnConnectionFactory.protocol
        )

        // HTTP/2 Connector
        val http2Connector = ServerConnector(this,
            sslConnectionFactory,
            alpnConnectionFactory,
            http2ConnectionFactory,
            HttpConnectionFactory(httpsConfig)
        ).apply {
            port = IPHelper.preferredEncryptedHttpsPort
            // IP You're listening on
            host = IPHelper.localNetworkIp
        }

        addConnector(http2Connector)
    }
}
```

So you run it and... 

```shell script
[main] INFO org.eclipse.jetty.server.AbstractConnector - Started ServerConnector@6b143ee9{SSL, (ssl, alpn, h2, http/1.1)}{127.0.0.1:8443}
[main] INFO org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server - Started @814ms
[main] INFO io.javalin.Javalin - Listening on https://127.0.0.1:8443/
[main] INFO io.javalin.Javalin - Javalin started in 302ms \o/
```

WE HAVE HTTPS!

# BUT IT DOESN'T RUN ON THE RASPBERRY PI!

---

So it turns out the underlying deep, deep, deep magiks that run through this server include something
called Conscrypt, which is some kind of SSL context provider thing that does really incredibly important
stuff and it wasn't built to run on arm32. Which my Pi is.

All of this to include better security on my tiny boxy but this lib chain doesn't support arm32 by
default. Apparently I'm allowed to build it myself for arm32...

It may be time to just get a different box to run on. Or, perhaps... a.. different server backend?...

Wow... how lame...
