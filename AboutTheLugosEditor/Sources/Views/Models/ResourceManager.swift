// * Read the list of available article bundle
//  - Includes article itself, and all files for article
// * Change name of article bundle
//  - Do this is the MetaView? Do this in the list?
//  - Might be safer to do from view
// * Reorder relative bundle order
//  - I think there needs to be a 'BundleInfo' that holds data
//  -- bundle name -> sort position
//  - I could use the ArticleMeta.id as the key...
//  - .. do I just set a date? Make the date modifiable?
//  - .. that makes a lot of sense.
